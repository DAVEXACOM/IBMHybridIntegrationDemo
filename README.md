4.	node.js test application for execution in IBM Bluemix
5.	Event enablement of the CICS to DB2 integration service for synchronization with SaaS applications such as Googlesheets and SFDC.
6.	Introduction of API Management and API proxy/gateway

Featured products:

1.	IBM Integration Bus v10
2.	IBM Bluemix - Secure Gateway and nodeRed
3.	IBM API Connect v5 (on Bluemix)

This repository contains the "end state" collateral for the demo. An IBM Integration Community article can be viewed at the following URL https://developer.ibm.com/integration/blog/2016/08/08/hybrid-integration-on-premises-to-multiple-clouds-going-beyond-the-whizz-bang-tool-demos/ that full explains the scenario and how it was build. The article will reference "key press by key press" instructional videos captured for every step of the build.

No programmers were harmed in the development of this collateral due to there being zero lines of code written in building out of this Hybrid Integration use case.
