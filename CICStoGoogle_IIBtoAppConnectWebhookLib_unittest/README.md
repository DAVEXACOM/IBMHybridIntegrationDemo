# IIBtoAppConnectWebhookLib unit tests
This directory contains tests for the project `IIBtoAppConnectWebhookLib`, which contains an IIB library 
with a subflow implementing a webhook design pattern.

These tests can be used to ensure changes to the webhook subflow preserves behaviours that are needed
for IIB to App Connect integration. In most cases changes to the webhook subflow will not be needed, and
so running these unit tests will not be necessary.

The tests are implemented in javascript using the Mocha test framework. Instructions to run the tests are
contained in javascript source comments.
